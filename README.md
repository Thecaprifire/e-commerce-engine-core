## Description:
Welcome to the e-commerce engine core! This project is part of the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge, aimed at building the back end for an e-commerce site. The challenge involves taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

This application is designed to handle various e-commerce operations, including managing products, categories, tags, and product tags. Although this application will not be deployed, a walkthrough video has been created to demonstrate its functionality and ensure all acceptance criteria are met.

## The Challenge:
To build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.


## User Story
```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```


## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
